# End-2-End-Testing_Form_Submitting

1. Test Scenario Scope: Developed an end-to-end test scenario covering both a "form submitting" and "e-commerce" webpage to ensure comprehensive testing of the entire application.
2. Testing Framework: Employed Pytest, a powerful testing framework in Python, to orchestrate the testing process. Pytest provides flexibility and robust features for writing and executing test cases efficiently.
3. Selenium Integration: Integrated Selenium, a popular web automation tool, to locate elements and interact with the webpages under test. Selenium's capabilities were utilized to simulate user actions and validate application behavior.
4. Page Object Model (POM): Implemented the Page Object Model design pattern to organize and manage web elements and actions within the test code. This approach enhances code maintainability, readability, and reusability.
5. Automatic Screenshots: Developed a program to automatically capture screenshots in case of test failures or skipped tests. This feature provides visual evidence of test execution outcomes for further analysis and debugging.
6. HTML Test Report Generation: Implemented functionality to generate an HTML test report after test execution. The report provides a detailed summary of test results, including passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with relevant metrics and statistics.
7. Logging: Included logging mechanisms to capture additional information during test execution. Logs provide insights into the test execution flow, errors encountered, and any other relevant events, aiding in troubleshooting and analysis.
8. Error Handling and Reporting: Implemented error handling mechanisms to capture and report errors encountered during test execution. In case of errors, the program automatically attaches the corresponding screenshots to the test report, providing visual context for error investigation.

By incorporating these features into the testing process, the end-to-end test scenario ensures thorough validation of the "form submitting" and "e-commerce" webpages, while also facilitating efficient debugging and reporting of test results.
