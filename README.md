# End-2-End-Testing_Form_Submitting

This is an end to end test scenairo for a "form submitting" and "e-commerce" webpage. I used Pytest for the testing and sleenium to locate and all. Finally the project is in "PAGE OBJECT MODEL". I also make a program if the test fails some where or skip it will take automatically screenshot. This test will also generate HTML report after the project it also have some logs for more info and finally if we got some error it will attach tge screen shot with it.
